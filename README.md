# IR Sensor Controlled Relay System

 Shows you how to control a relay based on the input from an infrared (IR) sensor.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board
- Infrared (IR) sensor
- Relay module
- Jumper wires
- Power source (e.g., battery)

## Application Overview

Uses an IR sensor to detect the presence of an object when an object is detected relay iwill be turned on and vice-versa. This can be useful for various applications such as security systems, automatic lighting control, and object detection projects.

### Uses

- Security systems: Detect intruders or movement in a specific area.
- Automatic lighting control: Turn on/off lights based on the presence of a person or object.
- Object detection projects: Trigger actions based on the detection of specific objects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Step 1: Connect Hardware

- Connect the IR sensor to pin D2 of the Arduino board.
- Connect the relay module to pin D5 of the Arduino board.
- Connect any required power source to the Arduino board.

### Step 2: Upload Code

- Copy the provided Arduino sketch and paste it into your Arduino IDE.
- Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

### Step 3: Run the Application

- Power on the Arduino board.
- Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view output.
- Place objects in front of the IR sensor to observe the relay turning on/off based on object detection.
